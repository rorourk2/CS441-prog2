# CS441-prog2

This app depicts a stick figure man running on a green ground. The background is the sky which slowly changes color to indicate changes in the time of day.
The user can hold the left or right side of the screen to move the figure left or right along the ground.

From the start of this assignment I wanted it to be focused on a guy running. I went back in forth as to whether I wanted the interactive aspect to make the guy move forward or jump.
I ultimately decided that moving forward and back would look a bit smoother and made that choice.

The changing time of day was also an idea I had early and probably what gave me the most trouble. I had originally tried to make the changing sky an animation, but after hours of attempting that, I realized I could just alter the background color.
